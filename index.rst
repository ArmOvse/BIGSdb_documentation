Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb)

*Gene-by-gene population annotation and analysis*

BIGSdb is software designed to store and analyse sequence data for bacterial isolates. Any number of sequences can be linked to isolate records - these can be small contigs assembled from dideoxy sequencing through to whole genomes (complete or multiple contigs generated from parallel sequencing technologies such as 454 or Illumina).

BIGSdb extends the principle of MLST to genomic data, where large numbers of loci can be defined, with alleles assigned by reference to sequence definition databases (which can also be set up with BIGSdb). Loci can also be grouped into schemes so that types can be defined by combinations of allelic profiles, a concept analagous to MLST.

The software has been released under the GNU General Public Licence version 3.  The latest version of this documentation can be found at http://bigsdb.readthedocs.org/.
