To delete the profile, click the 'Delete' link next to the profile. 
Alternatively, if your account has permission, you may be able to 'Delete ALL'
records retrieved from the search.

For deletion of a single record, the full record will be displayed. Confirm 
deletion by clicking 'Delete'. You can also choose to delete and
retire the profile identifier. If you do this, the profile identifier will not
be re-used. The database configuration can be set so that you can only delete
and retire.

To modify the profile, click the 'Update' link next to the profile following 
the query. A form will be displayed - make any changes and then click 'Update'.
