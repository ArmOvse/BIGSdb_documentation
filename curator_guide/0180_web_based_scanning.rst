************************************
Automated web-based sequence tagging
************************************
Sequence tagging, or tag-scanning, is the process of identifying alleles by 
scanning the sequence bin linked to an isolate record. Defined loci can either 
have a single reference sequence, that is defined in the locus table, or they 
can be linked to an external database that contains the sequences for known 
alleles. The tagging function uses BLAST to identify sequences and will tag the
specific sequence region with locus information and an allele designation if a 
matching allele is identified by reference to an external database.

Select 'scan' sequence tags on the curator's index page.

Next, select the isolates whose sequences you wish to scan against. Multiple 
isolates can be selected by holding down the Ctrl key. All isolates can be 
selected by clicking the 'All' button under the isolate selection list. On 
database with a large number of isolates, you will need to enter a list of 
isolate ids rather than pick from a list.

Select either individual loci or schemes (collections of loci) to scan against.
Again, multiple selections can be made.

Choose your scan parameters. Lowering the value for BLASTN word size will 
increase the sensitivity of the search at the expense of time. Using TBLASTX 
is more sensitive but also much slower. TBLASTX can only be used to identify 
the sequence region rather than a specific allele (since it will only match the
translated sequence and there may be multiple alleles that encode a particular 
peptide sequence).

By default, for each isolate only loci that have not had either an allele 
designation made or a sequence region scanned will be scanned again. To rescan 
in these cases, select either or both the following:

* Rescan even if allele designations are already set
* Rescan even if allele sequences are tagged

You can select to only use type alleles to identify the locus. This will
constrain the search space so that allele definitions don't become more 
variable over time. If a partial match is found to a type allele then a full 
database lookup will be performed to identify any known alleles. An allele can
be given a status of type allele when :ref:`defining<single_allele_upload>`.

If fast scanning is enabled, there will also be an option to 'Scan selected
loci together'. This can be significantly quicker than a locus-by-locus search 
against all alleles but is not enabled by default as it can use more memory on
the server and requires :ref:`exemplar alleles<defining_exemplars>` to be 
defined.

Options can be returned to their default setting by clicking the 'Defaults' 
button.

Press 'Scan'. The system takes approximately 1-2 seconds to identify each 
sequence (depending on machine speed and size of definitions databases). 
Alternatively, if 'Scan selected loci together' is available and selected, it 
may take longer to return initial results but total time should be less (e.g. 
a 2000 loci cgMLST scheme may be returned in 1-2 minutes). Any identified 
sequences will be listed in a table, with checkboxes indicating whether allele 
sequences or sequence regions are to be tagged.

Individual sequences can be extracted for inspection by clicking the 
'extract â†’' link. The sequence (along with flanking regions) will be opened in 
another browser window or tab.

Checkboxes are enabled against any new sequence region or allele designation. 
You can also set a flag for a particular sequence to mark an attribute.  These 
will be set automatically if these have been defined within the sequence 
definition database for an identified allele.

   :ref:`Sequence tag flags <sequence_tag_flags>`

Ensure any sequences you want to tag are selected, then press 
'Tag alleles/sequences'.

If any new alleles are found, a link at the bottom will display these in a 
format suitable for automatic allele assignment by 
:ref:`batch uploading to sequence definition <batch_allele_upload>` database.
