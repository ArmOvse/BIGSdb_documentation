page.

The next available id will be filled in automatically but you are free to 
change this. Fill in the individual fields. Required fields are listed first 
and are marked with an exclamation mark (!). Some fields may have drop-down 
list boxes of allowed values. You can also enter allele designations for any 
loci that have been defined.

Press submit when finished.

.. _batch_isolate_upload:

More usually, isolate records are added in batch mode, even when only a single
record is added, since the submission can be prepared in a spreadsheet and 
copied and pasted.

Select batch add (++) isolates link on the curator's index page.

Prepare your data in the spreadsheet - the column headings must match the 
database fields.  In databases with large numbers of loci, there won't be 
columns for each of these.  You can, however, manually add locus columns.

Pick a sender from the drop-down list box and paste the data from your 
spreadsheet in to the web form. The next available isolate id number will be 
used automatically (this can be overridden if you manually add an id column).

Press submit. Data are checked for consistency and if there are no problems you
can then confirm the submission.

Any problems with the data will be listed and highlighted within the table. Fix
the data and resubmit if this happens.
