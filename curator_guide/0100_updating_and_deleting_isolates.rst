********************************************
Updating and deleting single isolate records
********************************************
First you need to locate the isolate record. You can either browse or use a 
search or list query.

The query interface is the same as the 
:ref:`public query interface <isolate_query>`. Following a query, a results 
table of isolates will be displayed. There will be delete and update links for
each record.

   pair: deleting; isolates

Clicking the 'Delete' link takes you to a page displaying the full isolate 
record.

Pressing 'Delete' from this record page confirms the deletion. You can also 
choose to delete and retire the isolate. If you do this, the isolate id number
will not be re-used. It is possible to set the configuration so that you only 
have the option to delete and retire.

Clicking the 'Update' link for an isolate takes you to an update form. Make the
required changes and click 'Update'.

Allele designations can also be updated by clicking within the scheme tree and 
selecting the 'Add' or 'Update' link next to a displayed locus.

Schemes will only appear in the tree if data for at least one of the loci 
within the scheme has been added.  You can additionally add or update allelic 
designations for a locus by choosing a locus in the drop-down list box and 
clicking 'Add/update'.

The allele designation update page allows you to modify an existing 
designation, or alternatively add additional designations. The sender, status 
(confirmed/provisional) and method (manual/automatic) needs to be set for each
designation (all pending designations have a provisional status). The method is
used to differentiate designations that have been determined manually from 
those determined by an automated algorithm.
