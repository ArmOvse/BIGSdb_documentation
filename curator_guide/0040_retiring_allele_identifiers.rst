Retiring allele identifiers
***************************
Sometimes there is a requirement to prevent the automated assignment of a 
particular allele identifier - an allele with that identifier may have been 
commonly used and has since been removed. Reassignment of the identifier to a 
new sequence may lead to confusion, so in this instance, it would be better to 
prevent this.

You can retire an allele identifier by clicking the 'Add' retired allele ids
link on the sequence database curators' page. This function is normally hidden,
so you may need to click the 'Show all' toggle to display it.

Select the locus from the dropdown list box and enter the allele id. Click
'Submit'.

You cannot retire an allele that already exists, so you must delete it before
retiring it.  Once an identifier is retired, you will not be able to create a 
new allele with that name.  

You can also retire an allele identifier when you 
:ref:`delete an allele<update_delete_allele>`.
