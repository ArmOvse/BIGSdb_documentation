Linking isolate records to publications
***************************************
Isolates can be associated with publications by adding PubMed id(s) to the
record. This can be done when :ref:`adding the isolate <adding_isolates>`, where
lists of PubMed ids can be entered in to the web form.

They can also be associated in batch after the upload of isolate records. Click
the PubMed batch add (++) link on the curator's main page. This function is 
normally hidden, so you may need to click the 'Show all' toggle to display it.

Open the Excel template by clicking the link.

The Excel template has two columns, isolate_id and pubmed_id. Simply fill this
in with a line for each record and then paste the entire spreadsheet in to the
web form and press submit.

To ensure that publication information is stored locally and available for 
searching, the references database needs to be 
:ref:`updated regularly <updating_citations>`.
