***********************************
Retiring scheme profile definitions
***********************************
Sometimes there is a requirement to prevent the automated assignment of a 
particular profile identifier (e.g. ST) - a profile with that identifier may 
have been commonly used and has since been removed. Reassignment of the 
identifier to a new profile may lead to confusion, so in this instance, it 
would be better to prevent this.

You can retire a profile identifier by clicking the 'Add' link in the 'Retired
profiles' box on the sequence database curators' page. This function is 
normally hidden, so you may need to click the 'Show all' toggle to display it.

Select the scheme from the dropdown list box and enter the profile id. Click
'Submit'.

You cannot retire a profile identifier that already exists, so you must delete 
it before retiring it.  Once an identifier is retired, you will not be able to 
create a new profile with that name.  

You can also retire a profile definition when you 
:ref:`delete a profile<update_delete_profile>`.
