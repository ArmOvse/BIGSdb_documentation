Deleting multiple isolate records
*********************************

.. note::

   Please note that standard curator accounts may not have permission to 
   delete multiple isolates. Administrator accounts are always able to do 
   this.

Before you can delete multiple records, you need to search for them. From the 
curator's main page, click the update/delete isolates link:

Enter search criteria that specifically return the isolates you wish to delete.
Click 'Delete ALL'.

You will have a final chance to change your mind:

Click 'Delete'. You can also choose to delete and retire the isolate id. If 
you do this, the id number will not be re-used. It is possible to set the 
configuration so that you only have the option to delete and retire.
