*******************************
Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL)
*******************************
The ITOL plugin allows you to generate and visualise phylogenetic trees 
calculated from concatenated sequence alignments of selected loci (or the
loci belonging to a particular scheme). Currently, only Neighbour-joining 
trees are supported. Datasets can include metadata which allows nodes in the 
resultant tree to be coloured.

ITOL can be accessed from the contents page by clicking the 'iTOL' link.

Alternatively, it can be accessed following a query by clicking the 'iTOL'
button at the bottom of the results table.  Isolates returned from the query 
will be automatically selected within the iTOL interface.

Select the isolates to include. The tree can be generated from concatenated
sequences of any selection of loci, or more conveniently, you can select a 
scheme in the scheme selector to include all loci belonging to that scheme.

Additional fields can be selected to be included as metadata for use in 
colouring nodes - select any fields you wish to include in the 'iTOL datasets'
list. Multiple selections can be made by holding down Shift or Ctrl while 
selecting. You can also choose how nodes are labeled by metadata - either by 
colouring the labels or using coloured strips.

Click 'Submit' to start the analysis.

The job will be sent to the job queue. When it has finished, the generated
tree and associated metadata will be uploaded to the Interactive Tree of Life
website (https://itol.embl.de/). Click the button marked 'Launch iTOL'.

Your browser will open the iTOL website with your tree.

You can manipulate the tree in the browser, and display metadata by selecting
the appropriate toggle.

The tree layout can be changed by clicking the 'Basic tab' and, for example, 
selecting a circular display mode.

exporting trees.
