The Polymorphisms plugin generates a :ref:`Locus Explorer <locus_explorer>` 
polymorphic site analysis on the alleles designated in an isolate dataset 
following a query.

The analysis is accessed by clicking the 'Polymorphic sites' button in the 
Breakdown list at the bottom of a results table following a query.

Select the locus that you would like to analyse from the list.

Click 'Analyse'.

A schematic of the locus is generated showing the polymorphic sites.  A full 
description of this can be found in the 
:ref:`Locus Explorer polymorphic site analysis <locus_explorer_snp>` section.
