The Polymorphisms plugin generates a :ref:`Locus Explorer <locus_explorer>` 
polymorphic site analysis on the alleles designated in an isolate dataset 
following a query.

The analysis can be accessed by selecting the 'Analysis' section on the main 
contents page.

Breakdown list at the bottom of a results table following a query.

A schematic of the locus is generated showing the polymorphic sites.  A full 
description of this can be found in the 
:ref:`Locus Explorer polymorphic site analysis <locus_explorer_snp>` section.
