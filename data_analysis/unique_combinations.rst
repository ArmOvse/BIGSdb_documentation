Unique combinations
*******************
The Unique Combinations plugin calculates the frequencies of unique file 
combinations within an isolate dataset.  Provenance fields, composite fields, 
allele designations and scheme fields can be combined.

The function can be selected by clicking the 'Unique combinations' link in the
Breakdown section of the main contents page.  This will run the analysis on the
entire database.

Alternatively, it can be accessed following a query by clicking the 
'Combinations' button in the Breakdown list at the bottom of the results table.
This will run the analysis on the dataset returned from the query.  Please 
note that the list of functions here may vary depending on the setup of the 
database.
