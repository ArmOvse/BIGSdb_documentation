PhyloViz Online is a tool for generating and visualising minimum-spanning 
trees. Datasets can include metadata which allows nodes in the resultant tree
to be coloured interactively.

PhyloViz can be accessed by selecting the 'Analysis' section on the main 
contents page.

Alternatively, it can be accessed following a query by clicking the 'PhyloViz'
button at the bottom of the results table. Isolates returned from the query
will be automatically selected within the PhyloViz interface.

Select the isolates to include. The tree can be generated from allelic profiles
of any selection of loci, or more conveniently, you can select a scheme in the
scheme selector to include all loci belong to that scheme.

Provenance fields can be selected to be included as metadata for use in 
colouring nodes - select any fields you wish to include. Multiple selections
can be made by holding down Shift or Ctrl while selecting. Click 'Submit' to 
start the analysis.
