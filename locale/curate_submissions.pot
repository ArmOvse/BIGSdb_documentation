msgid "Data may be submitted by users using the automated submission system if it has been enabled for a specific database.  As a curator, you will be notified of pending submissions when you log in to the curator's interface or if you access the 'Manage submissions' links from the standard contents page.  Additionally, if your user account has the 'submission_emails' flag set in the users' table you will also receive E-mail notification of new submissions for which you have sufficient privileges to curate."
