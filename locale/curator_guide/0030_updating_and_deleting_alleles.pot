msgid "You cannot update the sequence of an allele definition. This is for reasons of data integrity since an allele may form part of a scheme profile and be referred to in multiple databases. If you really need to change a sequence, you will have to remove the allele definition and then re-add it.  If the allele is a member of a scheme profile, you will also have to remove that profile first, then re-create it after deleting and re-adding the allele."

For a specific allele, select the locus in the filter (click the small arrow next to 'Filter query by' to expand the filter) and enter the allele number in the allele_id field."

msgid "If you choose to delete, you will be presented with a final confirmation screen. To go ahead, click 'Delete'. Deletion will not be possible if the allele is part of a scheme profile - if it is you will need to delete any profiles that it is a member of first. You can also choose to delete and retire the allele identifier. If you do this, the allele identifier will not be re-used. It is possible to set the configuration so that you only have the option to delete and retire."
