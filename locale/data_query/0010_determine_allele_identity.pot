msgid "Paste your sequence in to the box - there is no need to trim. Often, you can leave the locus setting on 'All loci' - the software should identify the correct locus based on your sequence. Sometimes, especially in databases with a large number of defined loci, it may be quicker, however, to select the specific locus or scheme (e.g. MLST) that a locus belongs to."

msgid "If the locus you are querying is a shorter version of another, e.g. an MLST fragment of a gene where the full length gene is also defined, you will need to select the specific locus or the scheme from the dropdown box. Leaving the selection on 'All loci' will return a match to the longer sequence in preference to the shorter one."

msgid "The sequence query is not limited to single genes.  You can also paste or upload whole genomes - these can be in multiple contigs.  If you select a specific scheme from the dropdown box, all loci belonging to that scheme will be checked (although only exact matches are reported for a locus if one of the other loci has an exact match).  If all loci are matched, scheme fields will also be returned if these are defined.  This, for example, enables you to identify the MLST sequence type of a genome in one step."
