msgid "The ITOL plugin allows you to generate and visualise phylogenetic trees calculated from concatenated sequence alignments of selected loci (or the loci belonging to a particular scheme). Currently, only Neighbour-joining trees are supported. Datasets can include metadata which allows nodes in the resultant tree to be coloured."

msgid "Select the isolates to include. The tree can be generated from concatenated sequences of any selection of loci, or more conveniently, you can select a scheme in the scheme selector, or in the list of recommended schemes if these have been set up, to include all loci belonging to that scheme."

msgid "Additional fields can be selected to be included as metadata for use in colouring nodes - select any fields you wish to include in the 'iTOL datasets' list. Multiple selections can be made by holding down Shift or Ctrl while selecting. You can also choose how nodes are labeled by metadata - either by colouring the labels or using coloured strips."
