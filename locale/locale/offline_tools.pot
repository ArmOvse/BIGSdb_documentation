msgid "Automated offline sequence tagging"
msgstr ""

#: ../../offline_tools.rst:14
msgid "Sequence tagging is the process of identifying alleles by scanning the sequence bin linked to an isolate record. Loci need to be defined in an external sequence definition database that contains the sequences for known alleles. The tagging function uses BLAST to identify sequences and will tag the specific sequence region with locus information and an allele designation if a matching allele is identified by reference to an external database."

msgid "Defining exemplar alleles"
msgstr ""

#: ../../offline_tools.rst:192
msgid "Exemplar alleles are a subset of the total number of alleles defined for a locus that encompass the known diversity within a specified identity threshold. They can be used to speed up :ref:`autotagging<autotagger>` as the BLAST queries are performed against exemplars to identify the locus region in the genome followed by a direct database lookup of the sequence found to identify the exact allele found. This is usually combined with the autotagger --fast option."

msgid "Calculating assembly stats"
msgstr ""

#: ../../offline_tools.rst:443
msgid "Basic assembly statistics are calculated automatically by the database engine as contigs are added to the sequence bin. These include the number of contigs, total length and the N50 value. Some calculations, such as %GC, number of Ns, and the number of gaps however, require offline analysis since these involve inspecting the nucleotide content of each contig. These can be calculated by running the update_assembly_stats.pl script. You can choose to run this against all databases on the system or against a specific database."

#: ../../offline_tools.rst:451
#: ../../offline_tools.rst:505
msgid "Only one copy of the script can run at a time, but it will stop gracefully if it detects another copy running, so it is recommended that the script is run regularly using a CRON job and the --quiet option. This ensures that records are updated shortly after they have been uploaded."

It uses the PubMLST API to query either a genome sequence or rMLST allele designations to identify the species. When the analysis is run using the plugin, the results are also stored with the isolate record and can then be displayed within the isolate information page. This analysis can also be run offline using the update_rmlst_species.pl script."

msgid "Sometimes you may wish to stop running autotagger or allele autodefiner jobs as they can be run for a long time and as CRON jobs.  If these are running in single threaded mode, the easiest way is to simply send a kill signal to the process, i.e. identify the process id using 'top', e.g. 23232 and then ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../offline_tools.rst:557
msgid "The scripts should respond to this signal within a couple of seconds, clean up all their temporary files and write the history log (where appropriate).  Do not use 'kill -9' as this will terminate the processes immediately and not allow them to clean up."
