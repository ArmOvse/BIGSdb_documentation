If these table aren't present, they are created as temporary tables every time a query is performed that requires a join against scheme definition data. This requires importing all profile definitions from the definitions database and determining scheme field values for all isolates. This may sound like it would be slow but caching only has a noticeable effect once you have >5000 profiles."

msgid "Use a ramdisk for the secure temporary directory"
msgstr ""

#: ../../administration.rst:435
msgid "If you are running BIGSdb on a large server with lots of RAM, you could use some of this as a ramdisk for temporary files.  Debian/Ubuntu systems make available up to half the system RAM as a ramdisk mounted under /run/shm (or /dev/shm) by default.  Set the secure_tmp_dir to this RAM disk and you should see significant improvement in operations requiring the writing of lots of temporary files, e.g. tag scanning and the Genome Comparator plugin.  This is only likely to be appropriate if you have very large amounts of RAM available. As an example, the server hosting the PubMLST databases is a dedicated machine with 1TB RAM with temporary files rarely using more than 50GB space."
