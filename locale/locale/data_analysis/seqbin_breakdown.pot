msgid "The sequence bin breakdown plugin calculates statistics based on the number and length of contigs in the sequence bin as well as the number of loci tagged for an isolate record."

#: ../../data_analysis/seqbin_breakdown.rst:31
msgid "Select the isolate records to analyse - these will be pre-selected if you accessed the plugin following a query.  You can also select loci and/or schemes which will be used to calculate the totals and percentages of loci designated and tagged.  This may be useful as a guide to assembly quality if you use a scheme of core loci where a good assembly would be expected to include all member loci.  To determine the total of all loci designated or tagged, click 'All loci' in the scheme tree."

#: ../../data_analysis/seqbin_breakdown.rst:39
msgid "There is also an option to determine the mean G+C content and various assembly stats of the sequence bin of each isolate. Note that selecting these will make the analysis run much slower since each contig needs to be examined."
