msgid "The SNPsites plugin for isolate databases will create alignments for each selected locus for the set of isolates chosen. These alignments are then passed to the `snp-sites tool <https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp-sites>`_. which will generate VCF files for each locus. A summary table will be created showing the number of alleles and polymorphisms found for each locus."

msgid "Output consists of a summary file showing the number of sequences found in the dataset, the number of unique alleles, and the number of SNPs for each locus. An interactive chart is also displayed showing these values. Finally, Zip files are produced that contain FASTA alignments and VCF files for each locus."
