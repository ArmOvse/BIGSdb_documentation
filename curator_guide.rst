Please note that links displayed within the curation interface will vary 
depending on database contents and the permissions of the curator. Some  
infrequently used links are usually hidden by default. These can be enabled
by clicking the 'Show all' toggle switch. The admin section has feature-
specific toggles as well as a 'Show all' toggle.
