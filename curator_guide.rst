Please note that links displayed within the curation interface will vary 
depending on database contents and the permissions of the curator.

.. index::
   single: users; adding

*************************
Adding new sender details
*************************
All records within the databases are associated with a sender.  Whenever
somebody new submits data, they should be added to the users table so that 
their name appears in the dropdown lists on the data upload forms.

To add a user, click the add users (+) link on the curator's contents page.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_users.png 

Enter the user's details in to the form.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_users2.png 

Normally the status should be set as 'user'.  Only admins and curators with
special permissions can create users with a status of curator or admin.

If the submission system is in operation there will be an option at the bottom
called 'submission_emails'.  This is to enable users with a status of 'curator'
or 'admin' to receive E-mails on receipt of new submissions.  It is not 
relevant for users with a status of 'user' or 'submitter'.

.. index::
   single: allele sequences; adding

**************************************
Adding new allele sequence definitions
**************************************

.. _single_allele_upload:

Single allele
=============
To add a single new allele, click the sequences (all loci) add (+) link on the
curator's main page - if only a few loci are defined with permission for the
current user to curate then they will be listed individually and the specific
locus allele addition links can also be used.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles.png 

Select the locus from the dropdown list box. The next available allele id will
be entered automatically (if the allele id format is set to integer). Paste
the sequence in to form, set the status and select the sender name from the
dropdown box. If the sender does not appear in the box, you will need to add
them to the registered users.

The status reflects the level of curation that the curator has done 
personally - the curator should not rely on assurances from the submitter.  
The status can either be:

* Sanger trace checked

  * Sequence trace files have been assembled and inspected *by the curator*.
  
* WGS: manual extract (BIGSdb)

  * The sequence has been extracted manually from a BIGSdb database *by the 
    curator* .  There may be some manual intervention to identify the start and
    stop sites of the sequence.
      
* WGS: automated extract (BIGSdb)

  * The sequences have been generated by a BIGSdb tag scanning run and have had
    no manual inspection or intervention.
    
* WGS: visually checked

  * Short read data has been inspected visually using an alignment program *by
    the curator*.
    
* WGS: automatically checked

  * The sequences have been checked by an automated algorithm that assesses the
    quality of the data to ensure it meets specified criteria.
    
* unchecked

  * If none of the above match, then the sequence should be entered as 
    unchecked.
    
You can also choose whether to designate the sequence as a type allele or not.
Type alleles can be used to constrain the sequence search space when defining
new alleles using the :ref:`web-based scanner<tag_scanning>` or 
:ref:`offline auto allele definer<autodefiner>`.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles2.png 

Press submit. By default, the system will test whether your sequence is similar
enough to existing alleles defined for that locus. The sequence will be
rejected if it isn't considered similar enough. This test can be overridden by
checking the 'Override sequence similarity check' checkbox at the bottom.  It
will also check that the sequence length is within the allowed range for that
locus.  These checks can also be overridden by checking the 'Override sequence
length check' checkbox, allowing the addition of unusual length alleles.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`allele sequence flags <allele_sequence_flags>`

Sequences can also be associated with PubMed, ENA or Genbank id numbers by 
entering these as lists (one value per line) in the appropriate form box.

.. _batch_allele_upload:

Batch adding multiple alleles
=============================
There are two methods of batch adding alleles.  You can either upload a 
spreadsheet with all fields in tabular format, or you can upload a FASTA file
provided all sequences are for the same locus and have the same status.

Upload using a spreadsheet
--------------------------
Click the batch add (++) sequences (all loci) link on the curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles3.png 

Download a template Excel file from the following page.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles4.png

Fill in the spreadsheet.  If the locus uses integer allele identifiers, the 
allele_id can be left blank and the next available number will be used 
automatically.   

The status can be either: 'Sanger trace checked', 
'WGS: manual extract (BIGSdb)', 'WGS: automated extract (BIGSdb)', 
'WGS: visually checked', 'WGS: automatically checked' or 'unchecked'. See 
full explanations for these in the 
:ref:`single allele upload<single_allele_upload>` section.

The 'type_allele' field is boolean (true/false) and specifies if the sequence
should be considered as a type allele. These can be used to constrain the 
sequence search space when defining new alleles using the 
:ref:`web-based scanner<tag_scanning>` or 
:ref:`offline auto allele definer<autodefiner>`.

Paste the entire sheet in to the web form and select the 
sender from the dropdown box.

Additionally, there are a number of options available.  Some of these will 
ignore sequences if they don't match certain criteria - this is useful when 
sequence data has been extracted from genomes automatically.  Available options
are:

* Ignore existing or duplicate sequences.
* Ignore sequences containing non-nucleotide characters.
* Silently reject all sequences that are not complete reading frames - these 
  must have a start and in-frame stop codon at the ends and no internal stop 
  codons. Existing sequences are also ignored.
* Override sequence similarity check.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles5.png

Press submit.  You will be presented with a page indicating what data will be 
uploaded.  This gives you a chance to back out of the upload.  Click 'Import 
data'.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles6.png

If there are any problems with the submission, these should be indicated at 
this stage, e.g.:

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles7.png

.. _batch_allele_fasta_upload:

Upload using a FASTA file
-------------------------
Uploading new alleles from a FASTA file is usually more straightforward than 
generating an Excel sheet.

Click 'FASTA' upload on the curator's contents page.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles8.png

Select the locus, status and sender from the dropdown boxes and paste in the 
new sequences in FASTA format.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles9.png

For loci with integer ids, the next available id number will be used by default
(and the identifier in the FASTA file will be ignored).  Alternatively, you can
indicate the allele identifier within the FASTA file (do not include the locus
name in this identifier).

As with the spreadsheet upload, you can select options to ignore selected 
sequences if they don't match specific criteria.

Click 'Check'.

The sequences will be checked.  You will be presented with a page indicating 
what data will be uploaded.  This gives you a chance to back out of the upload.
Click 'Upload valid sequences'.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles10.png

Any invalid sequences will be indicated in this confirmation page and these 
will not be uploaded (you can still upload the others), e.g.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_alleles11.png

.. _update_delete_allele:

*************************************************
Updating and deleting allele sequence definitions
*************************************************
.. note::

   You cannot update the sequence of an allele definition. This is for reasons 
   of data integrity since an allele may form part of a scheme profile and be 
   referred to in multiple databases. If you really need to change a sequence, 
   you will have to remove the allele definition and then re-add it.  If the
   allele is a member of a scheme profile, you will also have to remove that
   profile first, then re-create it after deleting and re-adding the allele.

In order to update or delete an allele, first you must select it. Click the 
query (?) sequences (all loci) link - if only a few loci are defined with 
permission for the current user to curate then they will be listed individually
and the specific locus query links can also be used.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_alleles.png

Either search for specific attributes in the search form, or leave it blank and
click 'Submit' to return all alleles. For a specific allele, select the locus 
in the filter and enter the allele number in the allele_id field.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_alleles2.png

Click the appropriate link to either update the allele attributes or to delete
it. If you have appropriate permissions, there may also be a link to 'Delete 
ALL'. This allows you to quickly delete all alleles returned from a search.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_alleles3.png

If you choose to delete, you will be presented with a final confirmation 
screen. To go ahead, click 'Delete!'. Deletion will not be possible if the 
allele is part of a scheme profile - if it is you will need to delete any 
profiles that it is a member of first. You can also choose to delete and
retire the allele identifier. If you do this, the allele identifier will not
be re-used.

.. image:: /images/curation/delete_allele.png

If instead you clicked 'Update', you will be able to modify attributes of the 
sequence, or link PubMed, ENA or Genbank records to it. You will not be able 
to modify the sequence itself.

.. note::

   Adding flags and comments to an allele record requires that this feature is
   enabled in the :ref:`database configuration <seqdef_xml>`.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_alleles4.png

***************************
Retiring allele identifiers
***************************
Sometimes there is a requirement to prevent the automated assignment of a 
particular allele identifier - an allele with that identifier may have been 
commonly used and has since been removed. Reassignment of the identifier to a 
new sequence may lead to confusion, so in this instance, it would be better to 
prevent this.

You can retire an allele identifier by clicking the 'Add' retired allele ids
link on the sequence database curators' page.

.. image:: /images/curation/retire_allele1.png

Select the locus from the dropdown list box and enter the allele id. Click
'Submit'.

.. image:: /images/curation/retire_allele2.png

You cannot retire an allele that already exists, so you must delete it before
retiring it.  Once an identifier is retired, you will not be able to create a 
new allele with that name.  

You can also retire an allele identifier when you 
:ref:`delete an allele<update_delete_allele>`. 

***************************
Updating locus descriptions
***************************
Loci in the sequence definitions database can have a description associated
with them.  This may contain information about the gene product, the
biochemical reaction it catalyzes, or publications providing more detailed
information etc.  This description is accessible from various pages within the
interface such as an :ref:`allele information page<allele_definition_records>`
or from the :ref:`allele download page<download_alleles>`.

.. note::

   In recent versions of BIGSdb, a blank description record is created when a
   new locus is defined.  The following instructions assume that this is the 
   case.  It is possible for this record to be deleted or it may never have 
   existed if the locus was created using an old version of BIGSdb.  If the 
   record does not exist, it can be added by clicking the Add (+) button next 
   to 'locus descriptions'.  Fill in the fields in the same way as described 
   below.
   
To edit a locus description, first you need to find it.  Click the 
update/delete (?) button next to 'locus descriptions' on the sequence database 
curator's page (depending on the permissions set for your user account not all
the links shown here may be displayed).

.. image:: /images/curation/locus_descriptions.png

Either enter the name of the locus in the query box:

.. image:: /images/curation/locus_descriptions2.png

or expand the filter list and select it from the dropdown box:

.. image:: /images/curation/locus_descriptions3.png

Click 'Submit'.

If the locus description exists, click the 'Update' link (if it doesn't, see
the note above).

.. image:: /images/curation/locus_descriptions4.png

Fill in the form as needed:

.. image:: /images/curation/locus_descriptions5.png

* full_name

   The full name of the locus - often this can be left blank as it may be the
   same as the locus name.  An example of where it is appropriately used is
   where the locus name is an abbreviation, e.g. PorA_VR1 - here we could 
   enter 'PorA variable region 1'.  This should not be used for the 'common 
   name' of the locus (which is defined within the locus record itself) or the
   gene product.
   
* product

   The name of the protein product of a coding sequence locus.
   
* description

   This can be as full a description as possible.  It can include the specific
   part of the biochemical pathway the gene product catalyses or may provide
   background information, as appropriate.
   
* aliases

   These are alternative names for the locus as perhaps found in different 
   genome annotations.  Don't duplicate the locus name or common name defined 
   in the locus record.  Enter each alias on a separate line.
   
* Pubmed_ids

   Enter the PubMed id of any paper that specifically describes the locus.
   Enter each id on a separate line.  The software will retrieve the full 
   citation from PubMed (this happens periodically so it may not be available 
   for display immediately).
   
* Links

   Enter links to additional web-based resources.  Enter the URL first followed
   by a pipe symbol (|) and then the description.
   
Click 'Submit' when finished.

.. _single_profile_upload:

*************************************
Adding new scheme profile definitions
*************************************
Provided a scheme has been set up with at least one locus and a scheme field 
set as a primary key, there will be links on the curator's main page to add 
profiles for that scheme.

To add a single profile you can click the add (+) profiles link next to the 
scheme name (e.g. MLST):

.. image:: /images/curation/add_scheme_profile.png

A form will be displayed with the next available primary key number already 
entered (provided integers are used for the primary key format). Enter the new 
profile, associated scheme fields, and the sender, then click 'Submit'. The new
profile will be added provided the primary key or the profile has not 
previously been entered.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_scheme_profile2.png

.. _batch_profile_upload:

More usually, profiles are added in a batch mode. It is often easier to do this
even for a single profile since it allows copying and pasting data from a 
spreadsheet.

Click the batch add (++) profiles link next to the scheme name:

.. image:: /images/curation/add_scheme_profile3.png

Click the 'Download submission template (xlsx format)' link to download an 
Excel submission template.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_scheme_profile4.png

Fill in the spreadsheet using the copied template, then copy and paste the 
whole spreadsheet in to the large form on the upload page. If the primary key 
has an integer format, you can exclude this column and the next available 
number will be used automatically. If the column is included, however, a value
must be set.  Select the sender from the dropdown list box and then click 
'Submit'.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_scheme_profile5.png

You will be given a final confirmation page stating what will be uploaded.  If
you wish to proceed with the submission, click 'Import data'.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_scheme_profile6.png

.. _update_delete_profile:

************************************************
Updating and deleting scheme profile definitions
************************************************
In order to update or delete a scheme profile, first you must select it. Click 
the query (?) profiles link next to the scheme name (e.g. MLST):

.. image:: /images/curation/update_scheme_profile.png

Search for your profile by entering search criteria (alternatively you can use 
the browse or list query functions).

.. image:: /images/curation/update_scheme_profile2.png

To delete the profile, click the 'Delete' link next to the profile. 
Alternatively, if your account has permission, you may be able to 'Delete ALL'
records retrieved from the search.

For deletion of a single record, the full record will be displayed. Confirm 
deletion by clicking 'Delete'. You can also choose to delete and
retire the profile identifier. If you do this, the profile identifier will not
be re-used.

.. image:: /images/curation/delete_scheme_profile.png

To modify the profile, click the 'Update' link next to the profile following 
the query. A form will be displayed - make any changes and then click 'Update'.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_scheme_profile3.png

***********************************
Retiring scheme profile definitions
***********************************
Sometimes there is a requirement to prevent the automated assignment of a 
particular profile identifier (e.g. ST) - a profile with that identifier may 
have been commonly used and has since been removed. Reassignment of the 
identifier to a new profile may lead to confusion, so in this instance, it 
would be better to prevent this.

You can retire a profile identifier by clicking the 'Add' retired profiles
link on the sequence database curators' page.

.. image:: /images/curation/retire_profile1.png

Select the scheme from the dropdown list box and enter the profile id. Click
'Submit'.

.. image:: /images/curation/retire_profile2.png

You cannot retire a profile identifier that already exists, so you must delete 
it before retiring it.  Once an identifier is retired, you will not be able to 
create a new profile with that name.  

You can also retire a profile definition when you 
:ref:`delete a profile<update_delete_profile>`. 


.. index::
   pair: adding; isolates
   
.. _adding_isolates:

**********************
Adding isolate records
**********************
To add a single record, click the add (+) isolates link on the curator's index
page.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_isolate.png

The next available id will be filled in automatically but you are free to 
change this. Fill in the individual fields. Required fields are listed first 
and are marked with an exclamation mark (!). Some fields may have drop-down 
list boxes of allowed values. You can also enter allele designations for any 
loci that have been defined.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_isolate2.png

Press submit when finished.

.. _batch_isolate_upload:

More usually, isolate records are added in batch mode, even when only a single
record is added, since the submission can be prepared in a spreadsheet and 
copied and pasted.

Select batch add (++) isolates link on the curator's index page.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_isolate3.png

Download a submission template in Excel format from the link.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_isolate4.png

Prepare your data in the spreadsheet - the column headings must match the 
database fields.  In databases with large numbers of loci, there won't be 
columns for each of these.  You can, however, manually add locus columns.

Pick a sender from the drop-down list box and paste the data from your 
spreadsheet in to the web form. The next available isolate id number will be 
used automatically (this can be overridden if you manually add an id column).

.. image:: /images/curation/add_isolate5.png

Press submit. Data are checked for consistency and if there are no problems you
can then confirm the submission.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_isolate6.png

Any problems with the data will be listed and highlighted within the table. Fix
the data and resubmit if this happens.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_isolate7.png

.. _update_delete_isolate:

********************************************
Updating and deleting single isolate records
********************************************
First you need to locate the isolate record. You can either browse or use a 
search or list query.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_isolate.png

The query interface is the same as the 
:ref:`public query interface <isolate_query>`. Following a query, a results 
table of isolates will be displayed. There will be delete and update links for
each record.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_isolate2.png

Clicking the 'Delete' link takes you to a page displaying the full isolate 
record. 

.. image:: /images/curation/delete_isolate.png

Pressing 'Delete' from this record page confirms the deletion. 

Clicking the 'Update' link for an isolate takes you to an update form. Make the
required changes and click 'Update'.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_isolate3.png

Allele designations can also be updated by clicking within the scheme tree and 
selecting the 'Add' or 'Update' link next to a displayed locus.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_isolate4.png

.. image:: /images/curation/update_isolate5.png

Schemes will only appear in the tree if data for at least one of the loci 
within the scheme has been added.  You can additionally add or update allelic 
designations for a locus by choosing a locus in the drop-down list box and 
clicking 'Add/update'.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_isolate6.png

The allele designation update page allows you to modify an existing 
designation, or alternatively add additional designations. The sender, status 
(confirmed/provisional) and method (manual/automatic) needs to be set for each
designation (all pending designations have a provisional status). The method is
used to differentiate designations that have been determined manually from 
those determined by an automated algorithm.

.. image:: /images/curation/update_isolate7.png

***************************************
Batch updating multiple isolate records
***************************************
Select 'batch update' isolates link on the curator's index page.

.. image:: /images/curation/batch_update_isolate.png

Prepare your update data in 3 columns in a spreadsheet:

#. Unique identifier field
#. Field to be updated
#. New value for field

You should also include a header line at the top - this isn't used so can
contain anything but it should be present.

Columns must be tab-delimited which they will be if you copy and paste directly
from the spreadsheet.

So, to update isolate id-100 and id-101 to serogroup B you would prepare the
following: ::

  id     field     value
  100    serogroup B
  101    serogroup B

Select the field you are using as a unique identifier, in this case id, from
the drop-down list box, and paste in the data. If the fields already have
values set, you should also check the 'Update existing values' checkbox. Press
'submit'.

.. image:: /images/curation/batch_update_isolate2.png

A confirmation page will be displayed if there are no problems. If there are
problems, these will be listed.  Press 'Upload' to upload the changes.

.. image:: /images/curation/batch_update_isolate3.png

You can also use a secondary selection field such that a combination of two
fields uniquely defines the isolate, for example using country and isolate
name.

So, for example, to update the serogroups of isolates CN100 and CN103, both
from the UK, select the appropriate primary and secondary fields and prepare
the data as follows: ::

  isolate     country     field      value
  CN100       UK          serogroup  B
  CN103       UK          serogroup  B

*********************************
Deleting multiple isolate records
*********************************

.. note::

   Please note that standard curator accounts may not have permission to 
   delete multiple isolates. Administrator accounts are always able to do 
   this.

Before you can delete multiple records, you need to search for them. From the 
curator's main page, click the Query isolates link:

.. image:: /images/curation/batch_delete_isolate.png

Enter search criteria that specifically return the isolates you wish to delete.
Click 'Delete ALL'.

.. image:: /images/curation/batch_delete_isolate2.png

You will have a final chance to change your mind:

.. image:: /images/curation/batch_delete_isolate3.png

Click 'Confirm deletion!'.

****************************
Retiring isolate identifiers
****************************
Sometimes there is a requirement to prevent the automated assignment of a 
particular isolate identifier number - an isolate with that identifier may 
have been commonly used and has since been removed. Reassignment of the 
identifier to a new isolate record may lead to confusion, so in this instance,
it would be better to prevent this.

You can retire an isolate identifier by clicking the 'Add' retired isolates
link on the isolates database curators' page.

.. image:: /images/curation/retire_isolate1.png

Enter the isolate id to retire and click 'Submit'.

.. image:: /images/curation/retire_isolate2.png

You cannot retire an isolate identifier that already exists, so you must delete 
it before retiring it.  Once an identifier is retired, you will not be able to 
create a new isolate record using that identifier.  

You can also retire an isolate identifier when you 
:ref:`delete an isolate record<update_delete_isolate>`. 

.. index::
   single: isolate aliases

************************************************
Setting alternative names for isolates (aliases)
************************************************
Isolates can have any number of alternative names that they are known by. These
isolate aliases can be set when isolates are first added to the database or 
batch uploaded later. When querying by isolate names, the aliases are also 
searched automatically.

If :ref:`adding isolates<adding_isolates>` singly, add the aliases in to the 
aliases box (one alias per line):

If batch adding isolates, they can be entered as a semi-colon (;) separated 
list in the aliases column.

As stated above, aliases can also be batch added. To do this, click the batch
add (++) link on the curator's index page.

.. image:: /images/curation/isolate_aliases1.png

Prepare a list in a spreadsheet using the provided template. This consists of
two columns: isolate_id and alias. For example, to add the aliases 'JHS212' and
'NM11' to isolate id 5473, the values to paste in look like:

.. image:: /images/curation/isolate_aliases2.png

A confirmation page will be displayed.

.. image:: /images/curation/isolate_aliases3.png

Click 'import data'.

.. index::
   single: publications

***************************************
Linking isolate records to publications
***************************************
Isolates can be associated with publications by adding PubMed id(s) to the
record. This can be done when :ref:`adding the isolate <adding_isolates>`, where
lists of PubMed ids can be entered in to the web form.

They can also be associated in batch after the upload of isolate records. Click
the PubMed links batch add (++) link on the curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_publications.png

Open the Excel template by clicking the link.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_publications2.png

The Excel template has two columns, isolate_id and pubmed_id. Simply fill this
in with a line for each record and then paste the entire spreadsheet in to the
web form and press submit.

.. image:: /images/curation/add_publications3.png

To ensure that publication information is stored locally and available for 
searching, the references database needs to be 
:ref:`updated regularly <updating_citations>`.

.. _upload_contigs:

.. index::
   single: uploading contigs

****************************************************
Uploading sequence contigs linked to isolate records
****************************************************

Select isolate from drop-down list
==================================
To upload sequence data, click the sequences batch add (++) link on the 
curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs.png

Select the isolate that you wish to link the sequence to from the dropdown 
list box. You also need to enter the person who sent the data. Optionally, 
you can add the sequencing method used.

Paste sequence contigs in FASTA format in to the form.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs2.png

Click 'Submit'. A summary of the number of isolates and their lengths will be
displayed. To confirm upload, click 'Upload'.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs3.png

It is also possible to upload data for multiple isolates at the same time, but
these must exist as single contigs for each isolate. To do this, select 'Read 
identifier from FASTA' in the isolate id field and select the field that you 
wish to use as the identifier in the 'identifier field', e.g. to use isolate 
names select 'isolate' here.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs4.png

Provided the identifier used uniquely identifies the isolate you will get a 
confirmation screen. If the isolate name does not do this you'll probably have 
to use the database id number instead. Click 'Upload' to confirm.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs5.png

Select from isolate query
=========================
As an alternative to selecting the isolate from a dropdown list (which can 
become unwieldy for large databases), it is also possible to upload sequence 
data following an isolate query.

Click the isolate query link from the curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs6.png

Enter your search criteria. From the list of isolates displayed, click the 
'Upload' link in the sequence bin column of the appropriate isolate record.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs7.png

The same upload form as detailed above is shown. Instead of a dropdown list 
for isolate selection, however, the chosen isolate will be pre-selected.

.. image:: /images/curation/upload_contigs8.png

Upload options
==============
On the upload form, you can select to filter out short sequences from your 
contig list.

If your database has experiments defined (experiments are used for grouping 
sequences and can be used to filter the sequences used in 
:ref:`tag scanning <tag_scanning>`), you can also choose to upload your contigs
as part of an experiment. To do this, select the experiment from the dropdown

*****************************************
Linking remote contigs to isolate records
*****************************************
If :ref:`remote contigs have been enabled<accessing_remote_contigs>`, isolates
can be linked to contigs stored in an external BIGSdb database, rather than
directly uploaded. These well then be loaded when needed, for example during 
scanning or data export. This will be marginally slower than hosting contigs 
within the same database, but minimises duplication of sequence data and 
associated storage. Contigs need to be accessible via the BIGSdb 
:ref:`RESTful API<restful_api>`.

Click the sequences link icon on the curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/link_contigs.png

Either select the isolate id from the dropdown list, or enter it manually 
(list is disabled if there are >1000 records in the database). Enter the URI
for the RESTful API of the parent isolate record, e.g. 
http://rest.pubmlst.org/db/pubmlst_rmlst_isolates/isolates/933. This URI can
require authentication if credentials have been 
:ref:`set up<oauth_remote_contigs>`.

Press submit.

.. image:: /images/curation/link_contigs2.png

Summary information about the number of contigs and their total length will
be downloaded from the remote isolate record. You will then be prompted to
upload this information to the database, by clicking the 'Upload' button.

.. image:: /images/curation/link_contigs3.png

The contigs will be downloaded in bulk in order to determine their lengths. 
This information is stored within the local database as it is required for 
various outputs. Full metadata is not stored at this stage.

.. image:: /images/curation/link_contigs4.png

This is all that is required for the contigs to be used as normal. In order
to get the full metadata about the contigs (sequencing platform used, sender
and datestamp information), you can choose to process the contigs by clicking
the 'Process contigs now' button. This will download each contig in turn, and
store its provenance metadata locally. 

.. image:: /images/curation/link_contigs5.png

Alternatively, this step can be 
:ref:`performed offline automatically<processing_remote_contigs>`. 

.. _tag_scanning:

************************************
Automated web-based sequence tagging
************************************
Sequence tagging, or tag-scanning, is the process of identifying alleles by 
scanning the sequence bin linked to an isolate record. Defined loci can either 
have a single reference sequence, that is defined in the locus table, or they 
can be linked to an external database that contains the sequences for known 
alleles. The tagging function uses BLAST to identify sequences and will tag the
specific sequence region with locus information and an allele designation if a 
matching allele is identified by reference to an external database.

Select 'scan' sequence tags on the curator's index page.

.. image:: /images/curation/tag_scanning.png

Next, select the isolates whose sequences you wish to scan against. Multiple 
isolates can be selected by holding down the Ctrl key. All isolates can be 
selected by clicking the 'All' button under the isolate selection list.

Select either individual loci or schemes (collections of loci) to scan against.
Again, multiple selections can be made.

.. image:: /images/curation/tag_scanning2.png

Choose your scan parameters. Lowering the value for BLASTN word size will 
increase the sensitivity of the search at the expense of time. Using TBLASTX 
is more sensitive but also much slower. TBLASTX can only be used to identify 
the sequence region rather than a specific allele (since it will only match the
translated sequence and there may be multiple alleles that encode a particular 
peptide sequence).

By default, for each isolate only loci that have not had either an allele 
designation made or a sequence region scanned will be scanned again. To rescan 
in these cases, select either or both the following:

* Rescan even if allele designations are already set
* Rescan even if allele sequences are tagged

You can select to only use type alleles to identify the locus. This will
constrain the search space so that allele definitions don't become more 
variable over time. If a partial match is found to a type allele then a full 
database lookup will be performed to identify any known alleles. An allele can
be given a status of type allele when :ref:`defining<single_allele_upload>`.

If fast scanning is enabled, there will also be an option to 'Scan selected
loci together'. This can be significantly quicker than a locus-by-locus search 
against all alleles but is not enabled by default as it can use more memory on
the server and requires :ref:`exemplar alleles<defining_exemplars>` to be 
defined.

Options can be returned to their default setting by clicking the 'Defaults' 
button.

.. image:: /images/curation/tag_scanning3.png

Press 'Scan'. The system takes approximately 1-2 seconds to identify each 
sequence (depending on machine speed and size of definitions databases). 
Alternatively, if 'Scan selected loci together' is available and selected, it 
may take longer to return initial results but total time should be less (e.g. 
a 2000 loci cgMLST scheme may be returned in 1-2 minutes). Any identified 
sequences will be listed in a table, with checkboxes indicating whether allele 
sequences or sequence regions are to be tagged.

.. image:: /images/curation/tag_scanning4.png

Individual sequences can be extracted for inspection by clicking the 
'extract →' link. The sequence (along with flanking regions) will be opened in 
another browser window or tab.

Checkboxes are enabled against any new sequence region or allele designation. 
You can also set a flag for a particular sequence to mark an attribute.  These 
will be set automatically if these have been defined within the sequence 
definition database for an identified allele.  

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Sequence tag flags <sequence_tag_flags>`

Ensure any sequences you want to tag are selected, then press 
'Tag alleles/sequences'.

If any new alleles are found, a link at the bottom will display these in a 
format suitable for automatic allele assignment by 
:ref:`batch uploading to sequence definition <batch_allele_upload>` database.

Projects

Creating the project
====================
The first step in grouping by project is to set up a project.

Click the add (+) project link on the curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/projects.png

Enter a short description for the project.  This is used in drop-down list 
boxes within the query interfaces, so make sure it is not too long.

You can also enter a full description.  If this is added, the project 
description can displayed at the top of an isolate information page (but see 
'isolate_display' flag below).  The full description can include HTML 
formatting, including image links.

There are additionally two flags that affect how projects are listed:

* isolate_display - Setting this is required for the project and its 
  description to be listed at the top of an isolate record (default: false).

* list - Setting this is required for the project to be listed in a page of 
  projects linked from the main contents page.

Click 'Submit'.

Explicitly adding isolates to a project
=======================================
Explicitly adding isolates to the project can be done individually or in batch
mode. To add individually, click the add (+) project member link on the 
curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/projects3.png

Select the project from the dropdown list box and enter the id of the isolate 
that you wish to add to the project. Click 'Submit'.

.. image:: /images/curation/projects4.png

To add isolates in batch mode. Click the batch add (++) project members link 
on the curator's main page.

.. image:: /images/curation/projects5.png

Download an Excel submission template:

.. image:: /images/curation/projects6.png

You will need to know the id number of the project - this is the id that was 
used when you created the project. Fill in the spreadsheet, listing the 
project and isolate ids. Copy and paste this to the web upload form. Press 
'Submit'.

.. image:: /images/curation/projects7.png

.. _versioning:

*************************
Isolate record versioning
*************************
Versioning enables multiple versions of genomes to be uploaded to the database 
and be analysed separately.  When a new version is created, a copy of the 
provenance metadata, and publication links are created in a new isolate record.
The sequence bin and allele designations are not copied.

By default, old versions of the record are not returned from queries.  Most 
query pages have a checkbox to 'Include old record versions' to override this.

Links to different versions are displayed within an isolate record:

.. image:: /images/curation/versions.png

The different versions will also be listed in analysis plugins, with old 
versions identified with an [old version] designation after their name.

To create a new version of an isolate record, query or browse for the isolate:

.. image:: /images/curation/versions2.png

Click the 'create' new version link next to the isolate record:

.. image:: /images/curation/versions3.png

The isolate record will be displayed.  The suggested id number for the new 
record will be displayed - you can change this.  By default, the new record 
will also be added to any projects that the old record is a member of.  
Uncheck the 'Add new version to projects' checkbox to prevent this.

Click the 'Create' button.
