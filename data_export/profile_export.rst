You can export the allelic profiles for any indexed scheme (those containing a 
primary key field) defined in the sequence definition database.

The profile export function can be accessed by clicking the 'Profiles' link 
in the Export section of the contents page.

This will take you to a form with a list box in which the identifiers of the
profile definitions you wish to include can be entered. Following a query,
these values will be pre-entered. If the box is left empty then all profiles
will be included.
