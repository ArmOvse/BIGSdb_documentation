Alternatively, it can be accessed following a query by clicking the ‘Contigs’ 
button in the Export section at the bottom of the results table.

Select the isolates for which you wish to export contig data for. In databases
with a large number of isolates you will need to enter the id numbers rather 
than select from a list. If the export function was accessed following a query, 
isolates returned in the query will be pre-selected.

A table will be produced with download links.  Clicking these will produce the 
contigs in FASTA format.
