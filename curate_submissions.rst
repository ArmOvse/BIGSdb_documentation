Curating submitted data
#######################
Data may be submitted by users using the automated submission system if it has
been enabled for a specific database.  As a curator, you will be notified of
pending submissions when you log in to the curator's interface or if you access
the 'Manage submissions' links from the standard contents page.  Additionally,
if your user account has the 'submission_emails' flag set in the users' table 
you will also receive E-mail notification of new submissions for which you have
sufficient privileges to curate.

You will see a summary section that describes details about how the sequences
were obtained.  There should also be link here to download all the sequences
in FASTA format.

There will also be a table summarizing the sequences in the submission and
their current submission status.

Individual allele curation
==========================
Individual sequences can be curated singly by clicking the 'Curate' links next
to the sequence in the table.  If you have supporting data attached to the
submission, e.g. Sanger trace files then you may need to assess the submission 
based on the policy of the database.

Clicking this link takes you to the curation interface 
:ref:`single sequence upload page<single_allele_upload>`.  The upload form will
be filled with details from the submission.  You will need to manually set the
status from the dropdown list of values.

Clicking 'Submit' from this form will define the new allele and add it to the
database.  A link on the confirmation page will take you back to the submission
management page.

You will find that the status of the newly assigned sequence has changed in the
summary table.  The assigned value and status are determined on display and
should always reflect the live database values.

Batch allele curation
=====================
Often, you will want to batch upload submitted sequences.  This can be done by
clicking the 'Batch curate' button.

.. image:: /images/curate_submissions/curate_submissions10.png

This takes you to the 
:ref:`batch FASTA upload page<batch_allele_fasta_upload>` in the curators' 
interface.

The upload form will be filled with details from the submission.  You will need
to manually set the status from the dropdown list of values.

.. image:: /images/curate_submissions/curate_submissions11.png

Click 'Check' on this form will perform some standard checks before allowing
you to upload the sequences.

.. image:: /images/curate_submissions/curate_submissions12.png

A link on the confirmation page will take you back to the submission
management page.

.. image:: /images/curate_submissions/curate_submissions13.png

The status of the sequences should reflect their newly assigned status.

Rejecting sequences
===================
Sometimes you may need to reject all, or some of, the sequences in a submission.
You can do this by changing the value in the status dropdown box next to each
sequence.  Click 'Update' to make the change. 

.. image:: /images/curate_submissions/curate_submissions15.png

Closing the submission
======================
You can add a message to the submitter by entering it in the message box and 
clicking 'Add message'.  Once sequences have all been either assigned or 
rejected, the 'Close submission button' will be displayed.  Click this to close
the submission.  The submitter will be notified of their submission status.
