Private records
###############
Users with a status of 'submitter', 'curator', or 'admin' can upload private
isolate records that will be hidden from public view. A quota needs to be set
for the user by an admin before they are able to do this.

*************************
Uploading private records
*************************
In order to upload private records, you need to make sure that you are logged
in. If your account has a quota, there will be a menu item called 'Private
data'. Click the 'Upload/manage records' link.

You will see an overview of your quota and links to upload and edit your 
records. Click the 'Upload private isolate records' link (assuming you have
quota available).

You will then be taken to a curator page that allows you to upload data copy
and pasted from a spreadsheet. There is a link to an Excel template that you
will need to use to prepare your data - this is the same template used if you
were to submit your data to a curator.

See :ref:`batch adding isolate records<batch_isolate_upload>` for details of 
the upload process.

*************************
Modifying private records
*************************
Click the 'Upload/manage records' link on the contents page.

Now click the 'Update private records' link. You will be taken to the 
:ref:`curators' interface<update_delete_isolate>`, where you will be able to 
use the standard curator tools.

Use the :ref:`curators' interface<update_delete_isolate>` to make any changes 
to your isolate records, including 
:ref:`uploading genome data<upload_contigs>`.

*********************************
Sharing access to private records
*********************************
If :ref:`user projects<user_projects>` are enabled on the database, you can 
share access to your private isolates by adding them in to a user project and
then sharing this.

See :ref:`user projects<user_projects>` for more details.
