"This is a tool that can be used to simulate PCR reactions run against "
"genomes stored in the database. This is useful for designing and testing "
"primers. The plugin uses the `exonerate ipcress "
"<https://www.animalgenome.org/bioinfo/resources/manuals/exonerate/>`_ "
"program to perform its simulation."

"Enter your forward and reverse primer sequences in the appropriate boxes."
" These may contain wobble bases if necessary. You can also specify how "
"many mismatches are allowed for each primer. Finally, you can restrict "
"the reported length to only those products that fall between a minimum "
"and maximum length range."

"The exported sequences will include the primer regions. It is important "
"to note that, unlike a real PCR reaction, these sequences represent the "
"sequence within this region in the genome. In a real PCR reaction, the "
"primers are themseleves incorporated in to the product, so even if there "
"was a mismatch in the primer region, the product sequence would include "
"the primer sequence."
