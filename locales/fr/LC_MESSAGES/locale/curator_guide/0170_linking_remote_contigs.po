"If :ref:`remote contigs have been enabled<accessing_remote_contigs>`, "
"isolates can be linked to contigs stored in an external BIGSdb database, "
"rather than directly uploaded. These well then be loaded when needed, for"
" example during scanning or data export. This will be marginally slower "
"than hosting contigs within the same database, but minimises duplication "
"of sequence data and associated storage. Contigs need to be accessible "
"via the BIGSdb :ref:`RESTful API<restful_api>`."
