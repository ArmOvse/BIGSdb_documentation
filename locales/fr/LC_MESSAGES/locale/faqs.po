msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:9
msgid ""
"The software will run on fairly modest hardware. For an installation with"
" only local users, the following minimum is recommended:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:12
msgid "4 processor cores"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:13
msgid "16 GB RAM"

"As usual, the more RAM that is available the better.  Ideally you would "
"want enough RAM that the whole database(s) can reside in memory (an "
"approximation is roughly twice the total size of your contigs), although "
"this is not absolutely required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:22
msgid ""
"Offline jobs, such as :ref:`Genome Comparator <genome_comparator>` will "
"use multiple cores (depending on the settings in bigsdb.conf), so if you "
"want to run multiple jobs in parallel then you may want more cores (and "
"memory). Tagging of new genomes using the offline :ref:`autotagger "
"<autotagger>` is usually run in multi-threaded mode so the more cores "
"available the faster this will be."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:29
msgid ""
"As a comparison, the PubMLST site is run on two machines - separate web "
"and database servers. All offline jobs and tagging of genomes is "
"performed on the database server. These have the following specification:"

msgid "web server: 40 cores, 128GB RAM"

msgid "**Why might icons be missing when using Internet Explorer?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:38
msgid ""
"This can occur if you have Compatibility Mode enabled. BIGSdb generates "
"valid HTML5 and Compatibility Mode should not be used. Please ensure this"
" is not enabled in the Internet Explorer tools section."

"**BIGSdb is accumulating files in various temp directories - is this "
"normal and how do I clean them out?**"

#: ../../faqs.rst:50
msgid "**BIGSdb is complaining of an invalid script path - what does this mean?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:52
msgid ""
"In your database config.xml file system tag are two attributes - "
"script_path_includes and curate_path_includes. These contain regexes that"
" the web url to your script (bigsdb.pl and bigscurate.pl respectively) "
"must match. This prevents somebody from accessing a private database "
"using an instance of bigsdb.pl that is not in a protected directory if "
"you’re using apache authentication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:59
msgid ""
"So, if you access the script from http://localhost/cgi-"
"bin/bigsdb/bigsdb.pl then you can set script_path_includes to something "
"like “/bigsdb/” (which is the default), or “/cgi-bin/” or just “/” if you"
" don’t care about this check."

msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs.rst:68
msgid ""
"The easiest way to do this is to set up two or more separate "
"configuration directories that refer to the database. The URLs to access "
"these will differ by the value of the 'db' attribute, which refers to the"
" name of the configuration directory (in /etc/bigsdb/dbases/). The "
"database view accessed by each of these configurations can be different "
"as can the access restrictions."

msgid ""
"We have a database 'bigsdb_test' that contains data, only some of which "
"we wish to make publicly available. The isolates to make public are all "
"members of a project. First we can make a view of the isolates table that"
" contains only isolates within this project."

"This means that anyone with an account can log in and view all the "

"Now create a public configuration in /etc/bigsdb/dbases/test_public. This"
" will be accessible from http://IP_ADDRESS/cgi-"
