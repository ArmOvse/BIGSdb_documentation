"The Gene Presence analysis tool will determine whether loci are present "
"or absent, incomplete, have alleles designated, or sequence regions "
"tagged for selected isolates and loci. If a genome is present and a locus"
" designation not set in the database, then the presence and completion "
"status are determined by scanning the genomes. The results can be "
"displayed as interactive pivot tables or a heatmap. The analysis is "
"limited to 500,000 data points (locus x isolates)."

"Select the isolates to include. Analysis can be performed on any "

"also select a recommended scheme if these have been defined."
