"GrapeTree is a tool for generating and visualising minimum spanning "
"trees. It has been developed to handle large datasets (in the region of "
"1000s of genomes) and works with 1000s of loci as used in cgMLST. It uses"
" an improved minimum spanning algorithm that is better able to handle "
"missing data than alternative algorithms and is able to produce "
"publication quality outputs. Datasets can include metadata which allows "
"nodes in the resultant tree to be coloured interactively."
