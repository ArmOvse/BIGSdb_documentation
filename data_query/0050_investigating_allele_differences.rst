Sequence similarity
===================
To find sequences most similar to a selected allele within a sequence 
definition database, expand the 'Analysis' menu item and click 
'Sequence similarity' on the contents page.

Enter the locus and allele identifer of the sequence to investigate and the 
number of nearest matches you'd like to see, then press submit.

A list of nearest alleles will be displayed, along with the percentage identity
and number of gaps between the sequences.

Click the appropriate 'Compare' button to display a list of nucleotide 
differences and/or a sequence alignment.

Sequence comparison
===================
To directly compare two sequences, expand the 'Analysis' section and click 
'Sequence comparison' on the contents page of a sequence definition database.

.. image:: /images/data_query/sequence_comparison.png

Enter the locus and two allele identifiers to compare.  Press submit.

.. image:: /images/data_query/sequence_comparison2.png

A list of nucleotide differences and/or an alignment will be displayed.
