*****************************************
Searching for specific allele definitions
*****************************************
There are two query pages available that allow searching for specific allele
definitions.  The first allows querying of all loci together by criteria that
are common to all.  The second is a locus-specific attribute query that can
search on any extended attributes that may be defined for a locus.  This locus-
specific query also allows you to paste in lists of alleles for download or 
analysis.

General (all loci) sequence attribute search
============================================
To retrieve specific allele designations, click 'Sequence attribute search' on
a sequence definition database contents page.

Enter your query using the dropdown search box - additional terms can be added 
by clicking the '+' button.

Designations can be queried using :ref:`standard operators <query_operators>`.

Click 'Search'.

Click the hyperlinked results to display allele records.

Various search criteria can also be selected by combining with filters.  Click 
the filter heading to display these.

Locus-specific sequence attribute search
========================================
Some loci have :ref:`extended attribute fields <locus_extended_attributes>`.  
To query these, click 'Locus-specific sequence attribute search' on a sequence
definition database contents page.

.. image:: /images/data_query/sequence_attributes7.png

Pick the required locus from the dropdown box.

.. image:: /images/data_query/sequence_attributes8.png

The fields specific for that locus will be added to the dropdown query boxes.

The query form can be modified by clicking the 'Modify form options' tab:

.. image:: /images/data_query/sequence_attributes10.png

.. index::
   pair: list query; alleles

A list box can be added by clicking the 'Show' button for 'Allele id list box'.

.. image:: /images/data_query/sequence_attributes11.png

Close the form modification tab and you can now enter a list of allele ids for
retrieval.

Various analysis and export options will be available for use on the retrieved
sequences.  These include FASTA output and 
:ref:`Locus Explorer<locus_explorer>` analysis.
